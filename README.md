# Active Directory Project

A fully functional Active Directory lab environment built and configured for cybersecurity learning, monitoring, and attack simulation, inspired by [MyDFIR's YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/@MyDFIR). This hands-on project was designed to emulate a realistic enterprise setup and enhance blue team skills using open-source tools and virtual machines.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project simulates a small corporate environment with:
- A **Windows Server 2022** domain controller (Active Directory)
- A **Windows 10** client machine joined to the domain
- An **Ubuntu Server** running Splunk for log aggregation and SIEM
- A **Kali Linux** machine to simulate red team activity

The lab was built entirely using **VirtualBox** and configured to operate on a **NAT network** (`192.168.0.0/24`).
